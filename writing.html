                        How the hell did I become a writer&quest;&excl; Hahahahahah&excl; WTF.
                    </h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        I co-wrote a dramedy called I LOVE ACTING, BUT F&#42;CK THIS INDUSTRY with Raphel Famotibe. It&#39;s a piece of art that will begin in the realms of theatre, then become a TV Series (God willing).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        How did the idea of the play come about&quest;

                        Well, I was working in a school doing maintenance, refurbishing their library, whilst being covered in dust and slapping spiders off my arm. After a few days of this, a thought came to head &#8211; WHAT THE F&#42;CK IS MY LIFE&quest; 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I&#39;ve done all this actor training, got a degree, I&#39;ve got a few decent TV & Film credits. This can&#39;t be life. I sat down, super depressed, as time went on the depression slowly became anger and I thought nahh f&#42;ck this, I need to write this shit down. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I began to write down some really horrific thoughts and I called Raph and told him, yo I&#39;ve got an idea, I want to write a play about the industry and I want to tell the truth. Pretty quickly Raph was on it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the writing of the play it developed from being called “The Acting Industry” to “I LOVE ACTING, BUT F&#42;CK THIS INDUSTRY”. It became a play that was aiming to set EVERYONE free from the system and strong within who they are.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        
                        The play opened launched off at Theatre Peckham, selling out all three days we were there and will be coming back to life soon.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        
                        I dunno where my journey as a writer is going, but I can&#39;t lie, I love this sh&#42;t.
                    </p>

                    <p>
